TODO:

* Alert UI when a stream is killed or doesn't start
* Add an "all on" which will join all relay streams in a single ffmpeg process
* Add UI element that displays how long a specific stream has been on
* Allow services to be added by selecting from a dropdown and then added to the UI with emphasis on "Other".
* Route log messages to UI
